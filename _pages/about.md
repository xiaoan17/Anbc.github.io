I am currently a PhD student in Communication and Transportation, having started my studies at Southeast University in September 2023. My supervisor is Dr. Qu Xu. I focus on the application of artificial intelligence and data science in the transportation field, with current research interests including traffic flow prediction, vehicle trajectory prediction, and vehicle operation risk assessment. Future research plans include scenario generation and vehicle trajectory planning. With strong practical skills, I am capable of flexibly using various programming tools and automating processes to enhance work efficiency.

Looking forward to exchanging ideas and collaborating with you!
